The Stack class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out.

Methods:- 

empty() - It returns true if nothing is on the top of the stack. Else, returns false.

peek() - Returns the element on the top of the stack, but does not remove it.

pop() - Removes and returns the top element of the stack. An ‘EmptyStackException’ 
        An exception is thrown if we call pop() when the invoking stack is empty.

push(Object element) - Pushes an element on the top of the stack.

search(Object element) - It determines whether an object exists in the stack. If the element is found,
                        It returns the position of the element from the top of the stack. Else, it returns -1.

size() - The method returns the size or the number of elements present in the Stack.
